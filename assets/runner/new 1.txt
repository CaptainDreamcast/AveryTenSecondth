Avery: MY NAME IS AVERY TEN 2TH! AND I SWEAR ON MY HONOR AS A MAN THAT I CAN GET ANYTHING DONE IN TEN SECONDS!
Rando: That's cool, but i didn't ask, why are you telling me this?
AVERY: BE IT PIZZA DELIVERY, WATCHING A 10 HOUR YOUTUBE VIDEO OR EVEN MAKING A LUDUM DARE GAME, I WILL GET IT DONE IN TEN SECONDS FLAT!
Rando: You're hurting me with your grip!
Avery: THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME AVERY TEN SECONDS! AVERY FOR SHORT!
Rando: Please don't hurt me! I have a family, I have an infant daughter! I have money if that's what you want!
Avery: Off you go to your daughter in ten seconds with this improvised slingshot! Another satisfied customer.
Avery: Sometimes I wish there was a grander scheme for my talents to florish. Living my grand destiny.
Avery: Like this man that just appeared out of thin air.
Traveler: Are you Avery Ten 2th II? 
Avery: That I am, the Avery Ten 2th line goes back all the way to 1987.
Traveler: I am your son, Avery Ten 2th III. Exploits of your great ten second accomplishments have reached us in the future and we need your help.
Avery: Couldn't you just use your father from the future then?
Traveler: I can't. My father died young when a time traveler asked him for help to save the future.
Avery: Hmmm.
Traveler: You MUST help us! Neo-Cleveland has been taken over by an evil AI that changes the laws of physics every 10 seconds!
Avery: ... OF COURSE! And only I with my awfully specific talent of 10 second bursts can challenge him successfully.
Traveler: Then let us leave at once! To NEO-CLEVELAND IN THE YEAR OF 2023!!
Avery: JUST ONE YEAR IN THE FUTURE?! HOW DOES THAT EVEN WO-
Avery: My god... what have they done to this place?! It's completely destroyed... YOU... YOU MADMEN!!
Traveler: This is just regular Cleveland, we haven't traveled in time yet.
Avery: Ah, ok.
Traveler: Now we are in 2023 Neo-Cleveland. You can get I <3 Neo-Cleveland shirts at the post-apocalyptic gift shop over there.
Avery: Ah, ok.
Traveler: Now we must stop G.O.D., the AI that has taken over Cleveland-
Avery: Neo-Cleveland.
Traveler: For this, I have prepared a rocket powered tank with airborne capabilities.
Avery: Airborne?! You just added some balloons to it!
Traveler: Airborne balloons. Your  mission is to get close enough to G.O.D. and fire the G.O.D.S.L.A.Y.E.R. W.E.A.P.O.N. in the F.R.O.N.T. of the T.A.N.K.
Avery: I feel like you're going a bit overboard with the acronyms there!
Traveler: G.O.D.speed. May Cleve, the guardian deity of Cleveland be with you.
Avery: NEO-Cleveland!


Avery: ... Did the moon just crack?
Traveler: Phew.
Avery: Where did you come from?
Traveler: The me from this time died from the shot blast, so I time traveled back from the future to take the place of my past self.
Avery: But does that... Is that even... Shouldn't that... huh?
Traveler: Ah, it's the Cleves, the native residents of Cleveland. They must want to praise us for our efforts and reward us with offerings of goats and virgin maidens.
Cleve: Curse you, time travelers! Our benevolent king is dead!
Avery: B- But he literally changed the laws of physics every 10 seconds!
Cleve: The first consistent politician in earth's history!
Traveler: Plus he built roads.
Cleve: Yea, he built a lot of roads.
Traveler: WHY ARE YOU AGREEING WITH HIM, 3RD?!
Cleve: We haven't forgiven the Cleveland jokes from the intro cutscene either. Cleveland is a beautiful city in the heart of America.
Traveler: Yeah, what was that all about Avery?
Avery: AGAIN, AREN'T YOU PLAYING FOR THE WRONG TEAM HERE?!
Traveler: As atonement, I will not send you back home.
Avery: ATONEMENT?! YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE I CRACKED THE MOON OR SOME- ah.
Traveler: You will assist me in my true goal:
Traveler: FIND THE TIME TRAVELER WHO KILLED MY FATHER!
Avery: Hmmm.
Traveler: HE WAS THE SAME MAN WHO TAMPERED WITH THE AI AND TURNED IT INTO A GOD BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY!
Avery: Is this basically an admission of guilt?
And so the two Averies set out on their quest to find the man who killed Avery Ten 2th II.
It was a perilous journey, full of drama, despair, and even more Cleveland attractions. Eventually the moon fully cracked too.
The moral of the game is to live each moment to its fullest.
Avery: HOW WAS THAT THE MORAL OF THE GAME?!
Live could change...
Wait for it...
Every 10 seconds.
Avery: WHAT THE HECK?!
Traveler: Traveled from the future beyond the future to thank you for playing. This has saved the timeline from sure destruction.
Avery: Thanks a lot!
Cleve: The end.
